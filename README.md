An efficient Blood bank and blood donation management system

## How does it work?

* In the event of an emergency wherein a casualty at a hospital needs blood but the hospital doesn't have enough blood stocks to quench the demand, they'll be able to send a distress message to all nearby enrolled blood donors.
* An optimized list based on distance and availability of blood of a particular type in nearby blood banks will also be generated allowing for real time determination of where the required blood can be obtained from.
* Blood banks will be able to update their blood stocks in real time.
